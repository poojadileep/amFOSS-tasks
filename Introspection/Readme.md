# Introspection

# Why we must choose you?
I am having strong interest in programming and i am passionated in joining amFOSS.I always do find difficulties and errors in coding but i love trying it for many times and solving it.I love to try new projects and doing it my own. Yes,I may make mistakes but i love solving it by more and more trials and practising.

# What is your plan for next 6 months?
And yes this is one of the questions i ask to myself everyday! I want to try new things and learn new skills.I want to develop my coding skills along with focusing on my academics  as well as i want to continue my journey in dancing. amFOSS is the best oppurtunity i can get and if i got selected i am sure that i can develop my skills along with learning new skills.I want to learn and practise as much as i can in next 6 months.

# How would you contribute back to the club?
I am ready to do what club wants me to do wholeheartedly.I am interested in taking responsibilities and doing it, i am also interested in working in groups.

# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
This is the best selection process i have ever seen.This allows us to learn so many new things without any fear.It's such a good way to learn from mistakes,we are here free to make mistakes,search for ways to resolve it,try it again and learn it.And what i loved the most is,we are open to search,make mistake,try again,practise and learn.So stress free!

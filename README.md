# My Introduction
Namsahivayah Seniors, I am Pooja Dilep from Kerala.It was great to participate in this selection process.I was having no prior knowledge in programming but now i can see that i actually improved. I learned a lot of new things and found my interest in those topics.I am sure that i can improve a lot and learn new things if i got selected.I really wanted to join in the amFOSS club. When i started doing the tasks day by day the interest to join increased.

# Install Ubuntu

This seems to be an easy task but i took hours to complete it.I tried for few times to get my task succesfully completed.For the first few times my PC got stuck and installation failed,again i tried i searched about my issues on google ,i went through the articles about this in vidyaratna and thus i found solutions.Then i tried again peacefully and succesfully finished my task by installing ubuntu in dual boot mode.

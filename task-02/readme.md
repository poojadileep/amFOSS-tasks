# Begin your journey with Linux and Git

This task was a super motivation for me to try other tasks.

I took about 3 whole days to complete this,1 day to do all that and get the screenshot and 2 days to push that using git commands.
I searched for a long to get that git commands, And i was facing a lot of issues while pushing . Then i searched again and again then got few more commands ,then also many issues were there.Finally using all that commands given my 'solution.md' file i pushed it into my repo.

Completing this task was so satisfying and motivating.

# Flutter task
I was so interested to do this one.However this task is the one which took long and long hours ,then also incomplete.
There was a lot of issues while installing flutter,setting up the environment and installing editor.
At first flutter was not being installed,then android studio was not.
And when both got installed there was a lot of issues with sdk manager, about 3 times i uninstalled and reinstalled android studio.
I searched about it and fixed it up.Then my phone showed many issues while trying to run the demo program like 'adb exit with code 1' ,other adb issues and all.
I searched about and it turned on optimization and all in my phone.Finaly i was able to run the demo.
But android studio made my pc stuck for hours,i was not able run android studio.Hence i installed vscode and then i was able to start with the proper task.

Dealing with the code part was also difficult for me.I found it hard to understand but it never discouraged me ,Instead it encouraged me to learn and try.

# Setup a simple personal website
This is one of the tasks i loved the most.

Url of website: https://poojadileep.github.io/
Url of Repo : https://github.com/poojadileep/poojadileep.github.io.git

This task made me confused at some points but i enjoyed this one a lot.
It started from forking that given repo , and then it was a chain of confusions while installing jekyll and all.However i searched about it followed the steps given in the repo

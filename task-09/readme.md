# Setup a simple personal website
This is one of the tasks i loved the most.

Url of website: https://poojadileep.github.io/

Url of Repo : https://github.com/poojadileep/poojadileep.github.io.git

This task made me confused at some points but i enjoyed this one a lot.
It started from forking that given repo , and then it was a chain of confusions while installing jekyll and all.However i searched about it, followed the steps given in the repo and successfully completed the installation.I used that way of changing github repo name to publish the website.
It was really nice to do that customization.I changed layout,style,sort-by in the projects,i changed the topics and added data structers.I tried a lot to add my social media handle,at last i realized that i haven't deleted that '#' infront of it.Then i added my social media handles(instagram and hackerrank was the only 2 i had).And i added a blog too.

This task was fun and so interesting.
